                <p>Its been 8 months since I learned web development and now I am quite experience in web developmet and know how web development industries work.
                 I had done 5 projects till now and working as a web developer is a fun thing so far. From my experience I learnt that framewrks, such as ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, etc. makes web development a lot easier.
                    Making a website without any framework and only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a big pain. Yes, I believe that this frameworks are making web develpers life easier.
                    Working as a web developer has also taught me how to solve problems more easily and efficiently. Problem solving takes huge time but when we at the question with a proper perspective the problem turns out to be simpler.
